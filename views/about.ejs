                <h2>About Dawood</h2>
                <p>19-year-old student at Ontario Tech University pursuing Networking and IT Security with a focus on
                    Cybersecurity. My passion lies in understanding how systems work and how to protect them from
                    emerging threats.</p>

                <p>Beyond academics, I'm deeply interested in entrepreneurship and always looking for ways to turn ideas
                    into reality. Physical fitness is important to me - I regularly work out and practice combat sports,
                    which teach me discipline and mental toughness.</p>

                <p>I believe in continuous learning and pushing my boundaries, whether it's mastering a new security
                    tool, building a business concept, or improving my physical performance.</p>
