        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>Here are some projects I've worked on during my studies in Networking and IT Security. Each project
            represents skills I've developed and challenges I've overcome.</p>

        <section>
            <h3><i class="fas fa-network-wired"></i> Network Security Lab Environment</h3>
            <p>Built a virtualized network security lab using VirtualBox and pfSense firewall. Configured VLANs,
                implemented firewall rules, and set up IDS/IPS monitoring to simulate real-world enterprise network
                security scenarios.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> pfSense, VirtualBox, Snort IDS, Wireshark</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><i class="fas fa-bug"></i> Penetration Testing Report</h3>
            <p>Conducted authorized penetration testing on a virtual vulnerable machine (VulnHub). Performed
                reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and privilege escalation. Documented findings
                and provided remediation recommendations.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Kali Linux, Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><i class="fas fa-lock"></i> Secure Web Application</h3>
            <p>Developed a secure login system implementing password hashing, SQL injection prevention, and XSS
                protection. Applied OWASP Top 10 security principles to ensure the application follows security best
                practices.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> HTML5, CSS3, PHP, MySQL, Security Headers</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Network Traffic Analysis Tool</h3>
            <p>Created a Python script to analyze network traffic captures and identify suspicious patterns. The
                tool detects port scans, unusual protocols, and potential data exfiltration attempts from PCAP
                files.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, Scapy, Wireshark, Regular Expressions</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> IT Security Awareness Website</h3>
            <p>Designed and built a responsive educational website teaching basic cybersecurity concepts to
                non-technical users. Covered topics like phishing, password security, and social engineering with
                interactive examples.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Responsive Design</p>
